# Catalog ICRS to CIRS

In this example, we want to find the CIRS coordinates of a star called *Gliese 555*. The Hipparcos identifier of this star is 71253 and it's SIMBAD *main_id* is "BD-11 3759". It's basic catalog data from [SIMBAD](https://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=BD-11+3759) is:

```
ra             218.57004859310788
dec           -12.519559582093887
pmra                     -355.138
pmdec                      593.04
plx_value                159.9225
rvz_radvel                  -1.28
```

We need to convert some units befor using FAWS functions. Some useful constants for unit conversions are:

```
DR2D: Radians to degrees
DD2R: Degrees to radians
DAS2R: Arcseconds to radians
DMAS2R: Milliarcseconds to radians
```

The UTC date and time is 10th Feb 2024 at 22:32:37. The Earth Orientation Parameters have been obtained from IERS website.

We can convert ICRS to CIRS directly with `atci13` or first getting the star-independent context using `apci13` and then calling `atciq`. Both of them are shown here.

```swift
import FAWS

// Star data
let rc = 218.57004859310788 * DD2R
let dc = -12.519559582093887 * DD2R
let pr = -355.138 * DMAS2R
let pd = 593.04 * DMAS2R
let px = 159.9225 * 0.001
let rv = -1.28

// Time of observation (convert UTC to TT)
let (utc1, utc2) = dtf2d("UTC", 2024, 2, 10, 22, 32, 37.0)
let (tai1, tai2) = utctai(utc1, utc2)
let (tt1, tt2) = taitt(tai1, tai2)

// Earth Orientation Parameters
let dut1 = 0.00261476
let xp = 0.0473476 * DAS2R
let yp = 0.2368623 * DAS2R


// with atci13
var (ri, di, _) = atci13(rc, dc, pr, pd, px, rv, tt1, tt2)
print("\(ri*DR2D), \(di*DR2D)")

// with atciq
let (astrom, _) = apci13(tt1, tt2)
(ri, di) = atciq(rc, dc, pr, pd, px, rv, astrom)
print("\(ri*DR2D), \(di*DR2D)")
```


The output (in degrees):

```
218.586903349345, -12.622083449085888
218.586903349345, -12.622083449085888
```
